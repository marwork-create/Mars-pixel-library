These levels were created by yours truly from scratch[Well, except the background for BCM and the music for each stage]
The stages are as follows:
- Eagle 1 - This stage takes place atop of the Eagle 1 - The spacecraft seen in the Polish cartoon "Kapitan Bomba"
- The TTYD Rising Star stage - This level is based on the rising star battle stage seen in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door
- Bomb Candy Mines - That place takes place in the Bomb Candy Mines, a level seen in ANTONBLAST
Bomb Candy Mines is the only map not released to the public yet, as I need to work on the background and add in some other decorations as well.
